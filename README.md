# Swap-Cash
A Campus Exchange Platform
A web application built to facilitate peer-to-peer cash and UPI exchanges among students. It uses HTML5,
CSS3, and JavaScript for a responsive front-end. The UI is designed with the Bootstrap 5 framework, and data
is managed using Local Storage for client-side persistence.
